I've noticed a trend in the last few days , New Year... New me!!! Heres a few tips I started out with. For new members and ppl recommitting hope this helps!! I've strayed from strict keto to lazy at times but when I plateau I always revert back to eating as clean as possible.

## Keto Tips
 - No fruit, unless it‚Äôs berries in moderation... 
 - No wheat 
 - No sugar 
 - No grains 
 - No pasta 
 - No potatoes 
 - No rice 
 - No beans 
 - No starches 
 - No milk as it‚Äôs loaded with sugar. ( unsweetened almond milk is recommended.) 
 - HWC (Heavy whipping cream) is good in coffee or whatever you would like to use it for. 
 - Meat, cheese, eggs, vegetable, nuts, and healthy fats. It‚Äôs simple. Stick to that, and you should be ok!
 - Vegetables that should be avoided are... 
 - Sweet potatoes 
 - Corn 
 - Peas 
 - Potatoes 
 - Carrots - can be used in moderation, just don‚Äôt go over board. They are full of starches and not recommended. 

Make sure to drink half your body weight In oz of water as well if you aren‚Äôt getting the adequate amount of water it can be bad for your kidneys! This applies for all forms of keto. 

Do not forget your electrolytes, they are needed daily.

A good form of electrolytes is: 
 - Powerade zero 
 - Pickle juice 
 - Pink Himalayan salt added to your food  
 - Supplement if required 

Macros are a break down of the calories you intake for the day. Which should be... 
 - 5% carbs 
 - 20% protein 
 - 75% fat

 * Carb manager is a great app to track 
 * Carbs are a limit - try not to go over your carb limit. 
 * Fat is a lever - you don‚Äôt have to meet your fat macro, it‚Äôs simply there to help you get full. 
 * Protein is a goal- try your best to reach your protein goal, but try not to go over. Excessive amounts of protein can cause you to stall in weight loss. 

Anything other than this food group selection would be considered low carb. Also, if you are in ketosis, and eat outside of this food group not only could it take you out of ketosis, but it could spike your blood sugar! 
Hope this helps. üòä
If you are a keto newbie- This should help üëÄ
## Meats: ZERO CARBS üòçüòçüòç

 * Parmesan, Asiago
 * Ricotta- Freezes well, very versatile 
 * Cottage cheese- Good to throw in your lunch with berries, usually around 4-8g of Carbs per serving 
 * Cream Cheese- Freezes very well, this is one of the things that I always glance at whenever I go to the store, and always buy a bunch of if it's under $2 per 8oz. 

## Vegetables: No potatoes! Get your carbs from above ground veggies!!!

 * Broccoli- Great with cheese, steamed or just raw!
 * Asparagus- Awesome roasted or saut√©ed with bacon and garlic!
 * Cauliflower- AWESOME potato substitute!! 
 * Celery- Great with cream cheese or all natural peanut butter! 
 * Cabbage
 * Pickles (Read nutrition labels, watch for sugar and carbs) 
 * Olives
 * Green beans- Awesome saut√©ed in bacon grease with garlic, (watch portion size, though).
 * Onions- Red, yellow: use somewhat sparingly, to taste 

## Fruits: Most are a no-no, especially bananas, oranges and grapes.

 * Strawberries 
 * Blueberries
 * Raspberries 
 * Blackberries 
 * Lemon/Limes- Adds great flavor! 

## Nuts (grams of Carbs per 100 grams, or 3.5 oz)

 * Pecans/ Brazil (4g)
 * Macadamia (5g)
 * Hazelnut/Walnut/Peanut (7g)
 * Pine (9g)
 * Almond  (10g)
 * Pistachio  (18g)
 * Cashew (27g)

## Oils/Fats

 * Coconut Oil
 * Butter: Kerry Gold is best but just make sure it's REAL butter and not a spread or margarine
 * Olive Oil
 * Avacado oil
 * Vinaigrette 
 * Hollandaise 
 * Bacon/sausage grease
 * MCT oil- easily ordered online/in specialty stores. Available in most stores since this was copied. 

## Dressings/Condiments/Fats

 * Ranch, Blue cheese, Ceasar, Thousand Island, Balsamic- Watch carbs/ sugar, but there's tons of brands, so you can find one you love!
 * Mayo- Natural/organic is best, but I use Hellmann's all the time. 

Natural or sf peanut butter, jams and sauces are available but check labels for ingredients. 

Always research sweeteners and flours before using . I myself use monkfruit ( lakanto) and almond and coconut flour but there are many others out there. Good and bad.

Just because a label says Keto always check, many times for strict keto the ingredients are not keto friendly.
