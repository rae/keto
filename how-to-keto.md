# How To Keto
 - main source is [Thomas DeLauer](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThomasDeLauerOfficial/videos) on YouTube
 - reducing inflammation is key

# Veggies

## Asparagus
 - high in pre-biotic fibre
   - encourages the growth of healthy gut bacteria

## Bok Choi
 - powerful cruciferous vegetable
 - very high anti-estrogenic properties
 - helps flush out extra water

## Cabbage
 - has sulphuraphane in it
   - helps digest more easily
   - promotes good gut bacteria

## Broccoli
 - watch our for the sugars, as it adds up

# Fruit
 - goes through liver first, inlike other carbs
   - (simple sugars?)
 - can only process small amount of fruit at a time
 - want to go easy on them
 - stay low glycemic
 - stick to berries
 - 1/4 cup
 - Raspberries
 - Strawberries

# Fats
 - keep protein lean
   - helps control fats entering diet
   - animal fat may have high levels of bad things
      - estrogen
	  - soy
	  - omage-6
 - add fat separately
   - almond butter
   - other nut butters
   - mayonnaise
   - coconut oil
   - tahini
   - macadamia nuts

# Nuts

## Better than nuts
 - papitas, sunflower seeds
   - less inflamatory
   - less phytic acid
   - easy for body to break down
 - subflower seed butter (1 lb, Trader Joe's)

## Recommended
 - macadamia
   - no skin
   - easy to digest
   - low carb (4g/"serving")
 - brazil nuts
   - good to go
   - high in selenium
 - walnuts
 - pecans

## Be Careful
 - almonds
   - use in moderation
   - skin has phytic acid
      - which doesn't break down well in the body
	  - has anti-nutrients
	  - "analis"(?)-inhibitors
	  - body doesn't break buts down completely
	  - triggers inflamatory immune response
   - only eat a couple of ounces per day
   - they bloat you
   - if you can, "sprout" them
      - soak them in water overnight
	  - breaks down phytic acid
 - cashews
   - very inflammatory
   - dont' have too much
   - technically a fruit
   - high in carbs (10g/"serving")

# Protein / Meats
 - make sure you get more fats if you eat protein
 - body turns protein into carbs
   - gluconeogenesis
   - don't need to worry about it
   - carbs get stored as glycogen
   - stored in muscle cells
 - make sure fat : protein ratio is good (2:1 or higher)

# Other

## Omega-3
 - don't want Omega-6
 - eat lots of fish or fish oil
 - megadose 3000-5000 mg of fish oil supplement (pills?)
   - have it before bed
   - have it first thing in the morning

## Sodium, Magnesium
 - keep levels elevatged
 - makes a big difference

## Collogen
 - helps you feel better
 - deosn't get converted by gluconeogenesis as easily

# Cheeses
 - dairy should be moderated
 - can be inflammatory if you have a lot
 - lists are ordered least->most inflammatory

### Blue Cheese

| Calories: | 100 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Protein: | 6 grams |
| Fat: | 8 grams |
| Carbs: | 1 gram |
| Sodium: | 380 mg |
| Calcium: | 33% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) |

#### Study - Medical Hypotheses 

Found that metabolites produced by Penicillium roqueforti, andrastins A-D and roquefortine, have the ability to inhibit bacterial growth and reduce inflammation by increasing Peritoneal macrophages

Peritoneal macrophages are the macrophages that reside in the peritoneal cavity, a fluid-filled space located between the wall of the abdomen and the organs found in the abdomen

In the absence of peritoneal infection or inflammation, peritoneal macrophages are thought to have anti-inflammatory functions

### Feta Cheese

Feta, like all full-fat dairy, provides conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is associated with reduced body fat and improved body composition 

Artificial man-made trans fatty acids may not be healthy for humans, CLA, however, is a naturally occurring trans fatty acid, and is exempted from the labeling requirement because it is not considered to be harmful

One specific CLA isomer, 10E,12Z-CLA, has been associated with health benefits, such as reduced adiposity - impairs lipid storage in adipose tissue by altering the lipid metabolism of white adipocytes

10E,12Z-CLA reduces triglyceride storage due to enhanced fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis

a review paper that pooled the data from 18 controlled trials found that given at a dose of 3.2 g/d, CLA produces a modest loss in body fat in humans - can cause an average fat loss of about 0.1 kilograms per week, or 0.2 pounds per week, for about 6 months

### Goat Cheese 

| Calories: | 75 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Protein: | 5 grams |
| Fat: | 6 grams |
| Carbs: | 0 grams |
| Sodium: | 130 mg / 6% of the RDI |
| Calcium: | 4% of the RDI |

Goat cheese, also known as chèvre, is a tangy, soft cheese made from goat’s milk

Goat’s milk has more medium-chain fatty acids than cow’s milk, which are rapidly absorbed in your body and less likely to be stored as fat

Furthermore, goat cheese may be easier for some people to digest than cheese made from cow’s milk. This may be because goat’s milk is lower in lactose and contains different proteins. 

In particular, goat cheese contains A2 casein, which may be less inflammatory and less likely to cause digestive discomfort than the 

A1 casein found in cow’s milk

### Mozzarella

| Protein: | 6 grams |
| Fat: | 6 grams |
| Carbs: | 1 gram |
| Sodium: | 176 mg / 7% of the RDI |
| Calcium: | 14% of the RDI |

Mozzarella is a soft, white cheese with high moisture content. It originated in Italy and is usually made from Italian buffalo or cow’s milk.

Mozzarella also contains bacteria that act as probiotics, including strains of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum

### Swiss 

| Calories: | 111 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Protein: | 8 grams |
| Fat: | 9 grams |
| Carbs: | less than 1 gram |
| Sodium: | 53 mg |
| Calcium: | 25% of the RDI |

Swiss cheese hosts various compounds that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)

ACE narrows blood vessels and raises blood pressure in your body - so compounds that stifle it may help lower blood pressure

isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) and valine-proline-proline (VPP), which can relax your blood vessels to lower your BP

### Parmesan

| Calories: | 110 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Protein: | 10 grams |
| Fat: | 7 grams |
| Carbs: | 3 grams |
| Sodium: | 330 mg / 14% of the RDI |
| Calcium: | 34% of the RDI |

Ture parmesan made in Italy uses farm-fresh milk from cows that have never been fed silage (dried animal feed), which is very different from the processed parmesan you find in a plastic shaker 

Since it’s aged for a long time, Parmesan is very low in lactose and can usually be tolerated by most people who have lactose intolerance

### Cottage Cheese

| Calories: | 120 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Protein: | 12 grams |
| Fat: | 7 grams |
| Carbs: | 3 grams |
| Sodium: | 500 mg |
| Calcium: | 10% of the RDI |

Cottage cheese is made by adding an acid to pasteurized milk which causes a separation of the milk solids from the whey

It’s benefit is that it’s high in protein, but has a higher casein content than you'd get in milk

## Avoid

### Processed “Cheeses”

Types of processed cheeses:

The FDA has regulations on what is considered a cheese and what is not

Anything that’s processed cannot legally be sold as ‘cheese,’ and is marketed instead as a cheese product’—meaning it contains less than 51% cheese.”

FDA labeling guidelines so that you can gain insight into what you might be eating:

 - Pasteurized process cheese
    — contains 100% cheese
 - Pasteurized process cheese food
    — contains at least 51% cheese
 - Pasteurized process cheese product
    — contains less than 51% cheese

# Oils

## Avacado
- low flavour for high heat (grill etc)
- best price at CostCo
- has Omega-9's
   - recinforce Omega-3's
- has Oleic acid (just like Olive Oil)
   - converts into OEA in the body
   - mobilizes more fat, which is good
- want cold-pressed (no heat in process)
   - "centriguge" is fine too
## Canola, Safflour(?), Peanut, Corn
- look for "expeller pressed"
- don't want processed version (most common)
## Ghee
- clarified butter
- all milk solids removed
- pure butter fat
- technically lactose free
- high burning heat
   - becasue milk solids are gone
## Tallow
- also high cooking temps
## Olive
- only to 375ºF
